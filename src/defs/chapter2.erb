  @intermission="The map I got from professor Lapis was important for two reasons. The first was that it fell perfectly in line with rector Wright's vision for the University: it was a forgotten piece of the old wolrd knowledge which could be used to solve real-life problems in cooperation with the government. It was reassuring to know that even if my old mentor didn't like the direction in which the University was going, he was still willing to help his former students succeed. The second was a bit more selfish: the government rewarded scholars who helped it - and when it came to important resources like copper, they paid more than I would ever earn writing about coal mining (or, for that matter, writing about cartographic occultism).

	After a bit of preparation (which mostly involved dealing with all the usual University paperwork and bureaucracy), I boarded a clipper named [italic type]The Merchant of the Waves[note wave-merchant][roman type], headed to the Solstice Market which would be taking place in Vevvas[note vevvas]. The University paid the captain to set off early so that we could do a detour through the Vast Sea and he would still arrive on time.

	After five days of seasickness, I touched the dry land of Noninsula. The captain promised to return in three weeks, left me a sack full of dry rations and left."
