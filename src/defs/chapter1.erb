The University wanted to keep the minds of its scholars unplagued, and thus it transformed its building into the healthiest place in our country."

  @professor_arrives         = "As I fought against my own laziness and tried to force myself to work on my dissertation, someone entered my office without me even noticing. My first thought was to scold the visitor for his lack of manners, but I held my tongue - after all, who but the highest-ranking professors would think of himself highly enough to disregard the University manners so blatantly?

	It turned out that I was right: the unannounced visitor was none other than professor Lapis. He was dressed in a long, gray coat and there was a suitcase in his hand - there was no doubt about the fact that he was leaving the University. I didn't know then (and I still don't know now) if he was removed from his position or if he chose to leave after his group was disbanded and his disciples - me included - moved under different mentor, but at this moment i realized that the university politics are a lost cause.

	Five years ago, during the worst outbreak of the white plague, philosophers at the University found any existing school of thought unable to explain what has happening to our world. Thus, two schools of thought emerged. The first one was led by professor Lapis, and it argued that the plague revealed truth that used to be hidden behind our incomplete systems of knowledge. This worldview led to the creation of an interdisciplinary group (of which I used to be a member) which aimed to study those previously hidden forces. Its unusual approach to science and a serious interest in previously discredited fields like alchemy resulted in a derisive name 'plague mystics school' - a term we actually came to like. Our most vocal opponents were the 'democratic reality school' led by professor Sharp, which argued that our occult studies were as incomplete as the previous paradigms because knowledge creates reality as opposed to describing it. They saw the plague as an opportunity to rewrite the rules of the world and create a utopian society, controversially postulating that the University Grand Library must be burnt down to remove all the old world knowledge that is preventing us from realizing our true potential.

	The tragedy of university politics was not just that as time passed, the plague mystics became marginalized. It was the reasons why that happened. You see, it's not the democratic reality school taht defeated us. Our academic occultism and their revolutionary utopianism both lost against the conservative pragmatism of Constantia Wright, the University's new rector. As the society started to recover from the plague, she established close ties with the government, disbanded all interdisciplinary groups and brought back the division into three Institutes[note institutes].  She envisioned the university as an institutional guardian of the old knowledge that will rebuild the world after the plague[note wright]."
	@on_pragmatism           = "[line break]Many would say that Wright's reforms saved the University from irrelevance and made it into a powerful political and academic institution it is today. They might be right - but as always, there was a price to pay. Professor Lapis was one of those who paid it."
	@conversation_intro      = "I politely greeted my former mentor , apologized for the mess and offered him a tea in Cafe Campus. He declined, saying that he will only take a moment of my time as this was hist last day on the University and he still had a lot to do. He then said that while looking through his old papers, he found something that might help my academic career: a map showing a location of a small island. Apparently, decades ago its inhabitants mined copper[note copper] and sold it to our country, but knowledge of it was lost as a result of the plague. He put the map on my desk."
