  @cafe                 = "My return to the University was probably more eventful than my expedition. It was all rather stressful, so I often found myself relaxing at the famous Cafe Campus."
  @cafe_door            = "Cafe Campus was located on the University grounds. It was a place popular with both the students and the professors, and not just because it was the only one there. Rector Wright spared no expenses when buying teas and coffees, as she used this place to make the University seem more prestigious. Part of its charm was also its exclusivity - its doors were open for those who worked and studied here, but everyone else needed an invitation[note invitation]. Even my mentor who used to work here for years wouldn't be able to go there if I didn't invite him."
  @cafe_table           = "I sat at a table in the corner, far from the entrance. As I waited for my former mentor, I reflected on what happened after my return"
  @tea                  = "The day I met professor Lapis for the last time, I ordered an expensive (far more expensive than what I could afford on a regular basis, but fitting for that particular day) variety of black tea from Igt[note igt]."
  @tea_description      = "A cup of strong, slightly bitter tea. Expensive, but worth its price."

  @pre_ending           = "Back in the University, I presented my findings to the Institute of the Inanimate. I made sure to focus on the copper deposits and the mine. Predictably, the news of my journey travelled to the rector herself and she decided to organize a large-scale expedition. Several scholars from the Institute of the Societal expressed their desire to study the islanders and their settlements, but their proposals were quickly rejected by Wright who wanted to enforce strict separation between the Institutes. Thus, a university ship [italic type]Mind Voyager[roman type] was filled with geographers, geologists and engineers and sent straight towards Noninsula."
