Post-Ending ends when professor Lapis carries a piece of copper. When Post-Ending ends:
	say "I showed professor Lapis the strangely heavy piece of copper that I found in the Aeripolis mine. He took it in his hands, looked at it from all sides, noticed its unusual weight. He went quiet for an uncomfortably long period of time. I considered breaking the silence but couldn't bring myself to do it.

	When he spoke again, he told me the truth: the Noninsula expedition was his final experiment, and his last stand against the politics that led to him losing his position. He falsified the map (the original showed a common Vast Sea route to the Western Colonies), adding an island that the University wanted to exist. Noninsula didn't exist before he drew it (or maybe before I went there). The plan was to create an island that would be of interest to the University - adding a piece of plague mysticism to Constantia Wright's attempts at rebuilding the old world.

	The copper cone could have been his argument that the world worked according to his theories (although the same could have probably been said by the adherents of the democratic reality school), but it ended up being something else. He admitted that he didn't really understand it, and while he didn't admit that he was afraid of it, it was quite obvious that he was. He finished his coffee, said that the copper cone will lead him to a new, better theory and left. I never saw him again, and neither did anyone else from the University.

	What I did see was the slow but unavoidable change in the world. I now see that the plague was just the beginning, and that the reality as we know it is either falling apart or mutating beyond our recognition. People at the University still won't admit that, and they will say that the whole plague mysticism drove me to insanity - but deep inside, they know it too. There is chaos ahead of us, and we don't know how to fight it or control it. Maybe we can't. Maybe we can't even survive it.";
