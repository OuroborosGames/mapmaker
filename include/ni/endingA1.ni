When No Island begins:
	say "[italic type]Mind Voyager[roman type] returned from its journey after two weeks. Given that it was much slower than [italic type]Merchant of the Waves[roman type], the short duration of the expedition was rather surprising. More surprising was the story told by the travellers: apparently, they were unable to locate the island. Constantia Wright cursed their incompetence and sent a smaller ship, this time staffed only by the geographers specializing in navigation.

	Once again, the travellers returned with empty hands. Rector decided to send in yet another expedition just to be sure, but the results were predictable: the only thing they found was water.

	Of course, I was the next person to face her anger. I was accused of fabricating the results of my research and threatened with expulsion. I defended myself by mentioning the captain and the crew of [italic type]Merchant of the Waves[roman type] who brought me to and from the island. Unable to paint us all as liars and unwilling to admit to the flaws in her philosophy, she sent us to the Institute of the Animate for a medical examination. The University doctors decided that we suffered from collective hallucinations caused by a combination of autosuggestion, poisoning by spoiled food rations, chronic alcohol abuse and the overdose of Vevvasian Incense. I was forced to go through a few pointless therapy session, given an official reprimand for my lack of scientific rigor and placed on a month-long unpaid leave.

	It wasn't all for nothing though. Most of the doctors knew that the diagnosis they made was just an attempt to sweep the nature of our reality under the rug. This undermined Wright's authority and guaranteed that the schools of thought she fought against would survive. As time went by, the concept of democratic reality became an unofficial basis for the medical theories put forward by the Institute of the Inanimate, and the plague mysticism gained some popularity among students who founded a secret Brotherhood of Noninsula Seekers.".
