"university" or "future" or "plague mystics" or "plans"	"We talked about the professor's plans for the future, as well as the future of the University. He said that if the University wants mediocrity, he won't stop it from achieving it. As for himself, he will search for an institution that will appreciate his ideas."
"constantia" or "wright" or "rector wright" or "constantia wright" or "rector"	"We complained about rector Wright and her decision to disband the interdisciplinary groups, laughed at the idea that the worth of our studies can be measured by their usefulness to the government... and begrudgingly admitted that if she didn't take the lead, the University might have faded into obscurity as it spent money on overly abstract research wihtout attracting students or funders."
"sharp" or "professor sharp" or "democratic reality"	"When it came to his academic rivals, professor Lapis didn't think that they will last here much longer. Apparently, professor Sharp is planning to move east, where the effects of the plague were the most severe. Sharp thought that the people there are interested in the idea of democratic reality. According to Lapis, they didn't care about that, but a small religious sect was interested in his ideas about book burning[note sharps-fate]."
"plague" or "white plague"	"Professor Lapis was sure that the people will stop dying of the plague soon, but that its effects will carry over to the next generations. There is no coming back to the world that used to be."
"map" or "Noninsula" or "map of Noninsula"	"My former mentor didn't know much about the island. There wasn't much detail on the map (just the location of the island, a line representing a trade route which connected it to the mainland, and a short note about the prices of copper in 1751)."
"east" or "sect" or "treecutters"	"According to Lapis, the sect which gained popularity in the east was known as 'the treecutters' and worshipped the white plague itself.  They believed that permanence of knowledge is a blasphemous attempt to prevent gods from remaking the world as they see fit[note treecutters]."
