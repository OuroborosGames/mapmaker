When Noninsula Copper Company begins:
	say "The expedition was a great success. After a few months of studies, it turned out that the area can solve our country's copper problems completely, and thus the government established Noninsula Copper Company. Of course, all the glory went to the higher-ups at the Institute of the Inanimate as rector Wright decided to use this situation as an opportunity to create a legend about the exceptional wisdom of our professors. Still, I got a decent paycheck from that and I was allowed to abandon the boring studies of coal mining to write a doctoral dissertation about the unusual geographic features of Noninsula.

	When it comes to the political struggels inside the University itself, the Noninsula expeditions became a common argument in favor of Constantia Wright's leadership. Institute of the Inanimate proceeded with their electrification efforts, and even if they never managed to go beyond the University itself and a few of the largest cities, they managed to expand the rector's vision for the future from rebuilding the world to making it better than it was before the plague. In hindsight, it didn't quite work out, but that idea is still alive in the University.

	Still, as I was sitting in Cafe Campus, I couldn't help but wonder why did professor Lapis give me that map. After Noninsula Copper Company became a thing, interest in the occult experimentation has declined drastically. Did he sacrifice what was left of the plague mystic school of thought to help his former students? Did he know that the time of plague mystics has ended and decided to ensure that there's a place for us in this new University? Or maybe he strategically supported Wright so that there will be no place at the University for the democratic realists and their bookburning ambitions.".
