"map" or "map of Noninsula"	"I showed my former mentor the map of Noninsula - now filled in with the details I discovered during my journey. He looked at it, smiled and told me that he wasn't sure if this will work, but he's glad that it did."
"Noninsula" or "island"	"I described the island to professor Lapis. He listened carefully and seemed fascinated by it. Was he such a good actor or did he for some reason become interested in completely mundane, non-occult geography? I didn't know."
"journey" or "expedition"	"I told professor Lapis about my seasickness, the hardships of exploring the island, the joy of discovery. He appreciated the adventure, and said that now that he was free of the University-related responsibilities, he might try travelling just to see the world beyond the declining cities and dying schools."
"Merchant of the Waves" or "wave merchant" or "ship"	"We talked about my travels on a clipper ship - the difficulty of leaving home, the relief of returning, the contrast between the living conditions and the expensive cargo bought in Vevvas."
"Aeripolis"	"Professor Lapis was especially interested in the mining town of Aeripolis, and the people who lived there. He was disappointed in how little details I could provide, and hoped that the Institute of the Societal would study the Noninsulan society."
"tea" or "coffee" or "Cafe Campus"	"We shared our appreciation for Cafe Campus. My former mentor admitted that of all the things he could find on the University grounds, good coffee would be the one he will miss the most."
"brotherhood" or "seekers" or "Brotherhood of Noninsula Seekers"	"I told the professor about the Brotherhood of Noninsula Seekers, a small secret society formed by the students with interest in the philosophy of plague mystics. He was intrigued, but pessimistic - he predicted that the group will degenerate into a pretentious club for rich students who disguise their abuse of alcohol as something deeper."
