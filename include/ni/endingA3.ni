When Coal Not Copper begins:
	say "After [italic type]Mind Voyager[roman type] returned, many reports and analyses were written and even more debates were held. After we turned our knowledge of Noninsula into as many raw numbers as possible, our work was handed to the Institute of the Societal and its economists.

	The economists did not spend as much time on the details as we did. In fact, after less than one week they have gave us their calculation: due to Noninsula's difficult terrain, the costs related to mining, extracting and transporting the copper would be an order of magnitude greater than the possible profits. Noninsula was put on the maps with an annotation describing its copper deposits and unusual geography, but nothing more was done with it as the University had more important work to do.

	The Noninsula expeditions were a failure, but they were a failure for which the University was prepared. As time went by, everything went back to normal and I was reassigned to writing about coal mining in Dusty Mountains. After the eventful journey and hopeful return, the excitement has disappointingly faded and everything - the island, plague mystics, democratic realists, my scholarly ambitions - was dissolved in the boring practicality of everyday work. Constantia Wright's victory was entirely consistent with her worldview - quiet, grounded and inevitable.".
